Based on the modules and subsystems identified in your completed Design Diagrams (Assignment #4), you will enumerate the activities that need to be conducted to complete your project.

1) Identify and enumerate 10-25 project-specific tasks. Give one statement per task.

2) Each task statement should identify one team member of primary responsibility. Roughly speaking, each team member should be assigned as the responsible party for about 5 significant tasks necessary to complete the project.

3) Each task statement should begin with an appropriate verb, such as: specify, research, investigate, design, develop, obtain, document, test, validate, refine, etc.

4) Make sure that task statements use language consistent with your project description, design diagrams, and all project documentation.
