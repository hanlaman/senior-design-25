Each project group will create series of slides (PPT, keynote, etc) documenting their project. These slides will be used as part of your project submission to the Expo.  You may want to reuse some of the slide materials from your Fall Presentations. 
Each presentation must include at 9-10 well written slides. Your slide deck should include the following content:

1. Title - the project title, team members, and advisor

2.  Goals - description of the goals and the background of the project

3.  Intellectual Merits – statements about the interesting aspects of project, the innovative or original contributions and methods used in the design of the project.

4.  Broader Impacts – statements about how the project has potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.

5.  Design Specifications

6.  Technologies – discuss with some depth the computing technology developed and/or integrated into your project

7.  Milestones: list of milestones, deliverables with dates for the project

8.  Results: list the results you have achieved so far, and discuss your progress and the finishing tasks to complete your demo and all final deliverables.

9. Challenges: list the most significant challenges you were able to overcome through the work done on the project. Indicate your contribution to solutions to these challenges.
