## Project Sought  

For my capstone project, I am seeking an opportunity that leverages my experience in **artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data-driven applications**. I am particularly interested in projects involving:  
- Natural language processing (NLP) and translation systems.  
- Computer vision and video analytics.  
- Real-time data processing and system integration.  

My goal is to contribute technical expertise in ML model development, data pipeline design, and backend engineering to a project that has both **real-world applications and societal impact**.
