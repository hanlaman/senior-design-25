## Projects Sought
I am seeking a project that will combine the skills I've learned from my co-op experience with a new technology in an area I'd like to improve on and explore.
This area would also preferably be an emerging technology in the world today such as AI through LLMs, machine learning, or AR/VR.
I would also like a project that requires a challenge outside of basic web API architecture.
This would combine multiple systems that need to be integrated and maintained cleanly with an emphasis on upfront planning rather than jumping straight in.
