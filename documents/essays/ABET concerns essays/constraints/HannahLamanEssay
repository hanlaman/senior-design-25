Our project design for the wearable AI companion faces several important constraints that shape the possible solutions. Economic constraints are significant because advanced hardware components, secure cloud services, and licensed AI models can be costly, and as students we have limited funding. This pushes us toward low-cost hardware and open-source or educational software tools. Ethical constraints also play a central role, since the system handles sensitive personal and health-related information for people with dementia. We must make sure that all design choices protect user dignity, avoid harm, and prioritize clear interactions without confusion. Legal and security constraints overlap in our project, as privacy regulations such as HIPAA must guide how we store and transmit data, while we also guard against unauthorized access to sensitive information. These concerns limit which databases, communication protocols, and hosting solutions we can choose. Social constraints also guide our design, because the device will be used by a vulnerable population in real-world caregiving contexts. It must be simple to operate, comfortable to wear, and accessible to both users and caregivers. Finally, diversity and cultural impacts matter because users may speak different languages or prefer voices and interaction styles that reflect their cultural background. This requires us to design flexibility into voice settings and responses. Together, these constraints challenge us to balance practicality, cost, and inclusivity while ensuring the solution remains safe, ethical, and beneficial to society.
