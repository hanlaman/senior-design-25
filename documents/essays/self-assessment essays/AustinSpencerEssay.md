My senior design project is about creating a wearable AI companion for people with dementia. The device will give memory support, reminders, and guidance, while also offering emergency help and caregiver connections. It will use a friendly voice to remind users of who they are, where they are, and what they are doing. Over time it will adapt to their needs. From my point of view as a computer science student, this project is exciting because it uses artificial intelligence and software design to improve people’s daily lives in a meaningful way. It will also introduce a new me to mobile development which is something I have never done.

My college classes have prepared me well for this project. In AI Principles and Applications (CS2029C), I learned about machine learning models and how they can be applied to real world problems. In Design and Analysis of Algorithms (CS3003) and Data Structures (CS2028C), I gained skills in efficiency and problem solving, which will be important for building a wearable device. Database Design and Development (CS4092) taught me how to organize and store information, which will be useful for keeping track of user reminders. Operating Systems and Systems Programming (CS4071) gave me knowledge about how systems run and stay reliable. I also learned better communication through Technical and Scientific Writing (ENGL4092), which will help me explain and document our project.

My co-op jobs gave me even more experience that I can use in this project. At Core4ce, where I was an AI/ML Intern, I worked on translation models and servers, which taught me about building adaptable systems and handling data. At Azimuth, I worked on autoencoder models and project documentation, which gave me practice in both technical work and clear communication. At Kroger Technology and Digital, I designed computer vision systems with YOLOv8, worked with Jetson Nano hardware, and collaborated on projects using Jira. These experiences gave me strong technical skills in AI and software as well as teamwork, time management, and problem solving. I will use all of these skills in my senior design project to make sure it is both useful and reliable.

I am motivated to do this project because it helps people in a very direct way. Dementia affects many individuals and families and building a tool that gives support and comfort is something I personally care about. This device could be a support tool to help my grandpa who has dementia. Knowing I could make something to help his quality of life and help for all the things he forgets would mean so much to me. This project would also connect to my career goals, since I want to keep working with AI in areas that have real world impact.

My plan for the project is to work in steps. I will focus on making the system adapt to users’ needs. This is something that I believe will take a good amount of AI work, which I have some familiarity with. Other tasks I will complete will be helping with mobile development and connection to the wearable Bluetooth device. I expect the result to be a working prototype that is simple, helpful, and easy to use. I will evaluate my work by checking if the device runs correctly, meets the needs we set at the start, and is something that caregivers and users can both rely on. Once the project is in a stable prototype condition I be satisfied with the results.
