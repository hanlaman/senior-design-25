# Senior Design Individual Capstone Assessment

## Introduction
My senior design project focuses on developing an AI companion for individuals with dementia or other cognitive impairments, designed to assist them in remembering important personal information and daily tasks. This wearable device, which is a small button with a speaker and microphone, allows users to ask questions about themselves or their surroundings. It can provide contextually relevant reminders, such as who they are, where they are, or what they are doing, and conversations can be tailored based on the progression of their condition. The device will also feature emergency functionality, calling a caregiver or primary care provider if needed, and can integrate with smart home devices to provide situational alerts. A companion mobile app will allow caregivers to monitor activity, receive notifications, and manage reminders. Through this project, I aim to combine AI technology with human-centered design to enhance quality of life for users and provide peace of mind for caregivers.

## College Curriculum
My coursework at the University of Cincinnati has prepared me with both technical skills and project management experience that will guide the development of this AI companion. Classes such as **CS 4033 – Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Computing** and **EECE 3093C – Software Engineering** have provided me with the foundational knowledge to develop intelligent, adaptive systems and ensure they are built with maintainable, scalable architecture. Courses like **EECE 5132 – Software Testing and Quality Assurance** and **ENGL 4092 – Technical and Scientific Writing** have taught me the importance of rigorous testing, clear documentation, and communication, which are all skills that will be critical in ensuring the reliability and usability of this system. Beyond coding and algorithms, my graduate coursework in the ACCEND MBA program, including **Managerial Economics** and **Leadership and Organizations**, has strengthened my ability to approach complex problems strategically and manage projects collaboratively. Additionally, my involvement in hands-on projects and team-based assignments throughout my coursework has reinforced my ability to collaborate effectively, troubleshoot challenges in real time, and translate theoretical concepts into practical solutions. I plan to apply this combination of technical and business knowledge to ensure that both the AI device and mobile app are effective, user-friendly, and aligned with real-world needs.

## Co-op Experiences
My co-op experiences have provided practical, hands-on opportunities to apply classroom knowledge to real-world projects, preparing me to tackle the technical and organizational challenges of my senior design project. As an **Operations & Applied Data Analyst Co-op at AMEND Consulting**, I developed skills in process automation, data modeling, and financial reporting, which taught me how to design systems that are both accurate and scalable. At **FOX Sports as a Sports Analytics and SEO Co-op**, I built dashboards, conducted data analysis, and collaborated with cross-functional teams, improving my ability to create meaningful, actionable insights from complex datasets. Additionally, my earlier co-op at **84.51 in Infrastructure and Cloud Technology** gave me experience with cloud deployments and automated workflows, which will be useful for integrating AI processing in the wearable device and companion app. These experiences have strengthened my technical skills in Python, SQL, and system architecture, as well as soft skills like teamwork, communication, and project management, all of which I will leverage to create a reliable and impactful AI companion system.

## Motivation
I am deeply motivated to work on this project because it addresses a meaningful challenge that combines technology with human impact. Dementia and cognitive impairments affect millions of individuals and their families, and I am excited by the possibility of creating a tool that provides independence, safety, and comfort to users while supporting caregivers. I am particularly inspired by the potential for AI to adapt to users’ needs, providing personalized assistance and meaningful interactions. The project aligns with my passion for human-centered design and my interest in utilizing data-driven technology to solve real-world problems. My previous experiences in leadership, volunteer work, and co-op roles have shown me the impact that thoughtful technology and organized support can have on people’s lives, further fueling my commitment to this project. Contributing to a solution that can tangibly improve quality of life gives me both purpose and excitement to dedicate my full effort.

## Preliminary Approach and Evaluation
Our proposed preliminary approach involves developing the AI companion in iterative stages, beginning with core functionality like personalized responses, memory assistance, and emergency alerts. We plan to use machine learning algorithms to adapt conversations to the user’s cognitive abilities and integrate the wearable device with a mobile app for caregiver monitoring. In subsequent stages, we will potentially add a combination of smart home integration, contextual alerts, and customizable voice features. Expected results include improved user engagement, enhanced safety, and measurable benefits for caregivers through timely notifications and reduced confusion. We can self-evaluate my contributions by establishing clear milestones, conducting usability testing, and measuring AI accuracy, ensuring that each component of the project meets design and user-centered goals. Completion will be determined when the system functions reliably, is user-friendly, and effectively supports both users and caregivers.
