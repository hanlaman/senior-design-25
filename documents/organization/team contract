Part #1 Team Contracts: You should obtain the approval of a faculty advisor for your project, which includes the approval of all members of a 1-page draft of your team contract. A team contract draft should include the names and contacts for each team member, and should include some details about the expected timing and frequency of team meetings for this term. It should also include some general discussion about the project focus and the role of each team member. These roles will be fleshed out in future assignments (in particular, Assignment #5 Task List and Assignment #6 Effort Matrix). Your Team Contract Draft should be emailed to your advisor for approval. Submit your entire contract and approval evidence (e.g, email or signature) to Canvas.
