## Project Focus
Our project focuses on developing a wearable AI companion for individuals with dementia. The device provides personalized memory support, reminders, and guidance while offering emergency assistance and caregiver connectivity. It uses a friendly, customizable voice to help users recall who they are, where they are, and what they’re doing, adapting over time to their cognitive needs. The companion app allows caregivers to monitor activity, manage reminders, and receive notifications about the user’s well-being. Our goal is to improve independence, safety, and quality of life for users while supporting caregivers in daily routines.
