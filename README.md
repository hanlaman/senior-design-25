## 🧠 Project Abstract
The wearable AI companion enhances memory support, safety, and communication for individuals with dementia. 
This voice-activated device helps users recall personal information, receive reminders, and engage in comforting interactions through a customizable voice. 
Connected to a caregiver mobile app, it securely manages data synchronization, emergency alerts, and real-time monitoring. 
Emphasizing ethical design, privacy compliance (HIPAA), and affordability, the system integrates AI-driven speech recognition, text-to-speech, 
and cloud-based memory retrieval to promote independence and dignity through human-centered design.
