## User Stories
1. As a person living with dementia, I want to ask the AI questions about who I am and what I’m doing, so that I can feel reassured and maintain independence.
2. As a caregiver, I want to receive alerts and notifications from the AI system, so that I can monitor the safety and well-being of my loved one.
3. As a primary care provider, I want the AI companion to send me emergency alerts when the patient is confused or unsafe, so that I can respond quickly and ensure proper medical care.
4. As a family member, I want the AI’s voice to be customized to sound like someone familiar, so that my loved one feels comforted and less anxious.
